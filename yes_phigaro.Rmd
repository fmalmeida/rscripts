All prophages annotated using virsorter are showed in its [html report file](`r phigaro_html`) stored at ``r phigaro_dir``. Its genomic regions are summarized in Table \@ref(tab:phigaro-table).

It is worthy taking notes of prophage's genomic regions for better exploring its data using JBROWSE genome browser. This genome browser was automatically created (stored in a dir called `jbrowse`) and can be be used with [JBROWSE desktop](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse).

```{r phigaro-table}
# Produce Table
phigaro_txt %>%
  kable(caption = "Prophages annotated with phigaro software", escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = bt_opt, full_width = T, fixed_thead = T, font_size = 12)
