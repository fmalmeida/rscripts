All prophages annotated using phigaro are showed in its [html report file](`r phigaro_html`) stored at ``r phigaro_dir``. Its genomic regions are summarized in Table \@ref(tab:phigaro-table).

It is worthy taking notes of prophage's genomic regions for a better exploration of the data using JBrowse. This genome browser was automatically created (stored in a dir called `jbrowse`) and can be opened with [JBROWSE desktop](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse).

```{r phigaro-table}
# Produce Table
phigaro_txt %>%
  datatable(caption = "Prophages annotated with phigaro software",
          escape = FALSE,
          rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(pageLength = 5))
