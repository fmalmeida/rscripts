##### CARD database

Addtionally, the pipeline produces a summary table of genes annotated from [CARD database](https://card.mcmaster.ca/) since it has a comprehensive catalog of AMR genes.

```{r echo=FALSE, comment="", eval=TRUE}
if (!is.na(file.info(params$card_summary)$size) && params$card_summary != 'na') {
  df <- read.delim(params$card_summary, header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
  if (!nrow(df)) {cat("The summary table for this database is empty. Or the database was not used, or no element were found!")} else {df} 
  } else {cat("The summary table for this database is empty. Or the database was not used, or no element were found!")}
```
