All prophages annotated using phigaro are better shown in its own [html report file](`r phigaro_html`). The genomic regions predicted as putative prophage sequences are summarized in Table \@ref(tab:phigaro-table).

* Check it out at:
    + Dir: ``r phigaro_dir``
    + HTML: ``r phigaro_html``

> It is worthy taking notes of prophage's genomic regions for a better exploration using the JBROWSE genome browser provided. This genome browser was automatically created (stored in a dir called `jbrowse`) and can be visualized with [JBROWSE desktop](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse).
