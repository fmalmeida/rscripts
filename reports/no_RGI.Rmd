No AMR gene was annotated using CARD RGI tool. This means that either the genome has no AMR gene or the resistance prediction module was not executed. If you believe that at least one gene should be present in the query genome, please use the [RGI annotation program from CARD](https://card.mcmaster.ca/analyze/rgi).
