Not a single gene from known ICEs was found in the query genome. This might have happened because your blast thresholds were too stringent or because the genome have no integrative element in its content.

Therefore, it is advisable to take a better look at the parameters used and consider the query genome biology to define which scenario is the one that best suits your data. If you believe that the genome must contain any ICE you can perform another prediction with [ICEberg tools](https://bioinfo-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/ICEberg/index.php).
