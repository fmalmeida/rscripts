## Analysis of plasmid replicons

Plasmid annotation was performed with [Plasmidfinder](https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/PlasmidFinder/), a tool for _in silico_ detection of plasmids. Its results are summarized below:

* The complete results can be found in the directory `plasmidfinder_results` under the output directory.
