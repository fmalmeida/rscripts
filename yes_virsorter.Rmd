Virsorter outputs are stored in ``r virsorter_dir`` directory. Each prophage annotated have its DNA sequence stored in a single fasta file at `fasta` dir, under virsorter main directory. 

A summary of virsorter annotation is showed in Table \@ref(tab:virsorter-table). All features can fall within three categories. They are:

* **Category 1 = sure**
* **Category 2 = somewhat sure**
* **Category 3 = not sure**
