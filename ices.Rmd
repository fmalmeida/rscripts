#### Integrative and conjugative elements (ices) annotated

These elements were annotated from the [ICEberg database](http://db-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/ICEberg/), using blastx and blastn methods.

* Files:
    * GFF: ``r ice_gff``
    * Summary table: ``r ice_summary``

Summary table overview:

```{r echo=FALSE, comment="", eval=TRUE}
if (!is.na(file.info(ice_summary)$size) && ice_summary != 'na') {
df <- read.delim(ice_summary, header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
df } else {cat("The summary table for this database is empty. Or the database was not used, or no element were found!")}
```
