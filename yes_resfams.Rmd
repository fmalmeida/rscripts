These elements were annotated from the [Resfams database](http://www.dantaslab.org/resfams/). This database contains genes related to antibiotic resistance genes as well as environmental stress. We can't create an antibiogram using this database but it is extremely informative in terms of environmental resistance to stress. This data is summarized in Table \@ref(tab:resfams-resistance-table).

> Resfams database have no searchable online dabatase. Therefore, its results have no links and are only showed here two inform the users gene products annotated from this database.

```{r resfams-resistance-table}
# To upper
resfams_summary$`Query Protein ID` <- toupper(resfams_summary$Prokka_ID)

# Create Position Column
resfams_summary$`Query Protein Coordinates` <- paste(resfams_summary$seqname, ":", resfams_summary$start, "-", resfams_summary$end)

# Create Kable table
resfams_summary %>%
  select(`Query Protein ID`, Prokka_product, `Query Protein Coordinates`) %>%
  arrange(Prokka_product) %>%
