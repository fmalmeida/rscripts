#### Virulence databases

In this pipeline, the virulence genes could be annotated from two different databases:

* [VFDB database](http://www.phidias.us/victors/) and;
    * Was this database used? - ``r is_VFDB``
* [Victors database](http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/).
    * Was this database used? - ``r is_Victors``
* Files containg genes pottentially related to virulence:
    * GFF: ``r virulence_gff``
    * Summary table: ``r virulence_summary``

##### Summary table overview:

```{r echo=FALSE, comment="", eval=TRUE}
if (file.info(ice_summary)$size > 0) {
df <- read.delim(virulence_summary, header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
df } else {cat("The summary table for these databases is empty. Or the databases were not used, or no element was found!")}
```

##### GFF overview:

```{r echo=FALSE, comment="", eval=TRUE}
if (file.info(ice_summary)$size > 0) {
gffFile <- ballgown::gffRead(virulence_gff)
gffFile } else {cat("The gff file for these databases is empty. Or the databases were not used, or no element was found!")}
```
